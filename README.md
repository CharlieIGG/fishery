# Fishery

Fishery is a library for setting up JavaScript objects for use in tests. It is modeled after the Ruby gem, [Factory Bot][factory_bot].

Fishery is built with TypeScript in mind, so your factories will always return typed objects. If you aren't using TypeScript, that's fine too -- Fishery will still work, just without the extra typechecking that comes with TypeScript.

### Getting Started

```
npm install --save fishery
```

```
