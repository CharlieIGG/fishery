# Fishery

Fishery is a library for setting up JavaScript objects for use in tests, Storybook, and anywhere else you need to set up data. It is modeled after the Ruby gem, [factory_bot][factory_bot].

Fishery is built with TypeScript in mind. Factories return typed objects, so you can be confident that the data used in your tests is valid. If you aren't using TypeScript, that's fine too â€“ Fishery still works, just without the extra typechecking that comes with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Coming soon to NPM. In the meantime:

```
npm install --save git+ssh://git@github.com/thoughtbot/fishery
```

or, if using Yarn:

```
yarn add git+ssh://git@github.com/thoughtbot/fishery
```

## Usage

It is generally recommended to define one factory per file and then combine them together to form a `factories` object which can then be used in tests, Storybook, etc.:

### Define factories

```typescript
// factories/user.ts
import { Factory } from 'fishery';
import { User } from '../types';

export default Factory.define<User>(({ sequence }) => ({
  id: sequence,
  name: 'Bob',
}));
```

### Combine factories

This step is optional and is just for convenience.

```typescript
// factories/index.ts
import user from './user';
import post from './post';

export const factories = {
  user,
  post,
};
```

### Use factories

```typescript
// my-test.test.ts
import { factories } from './factories';

const user = factories.user.build({ name: 'Susan' });
```

## Documentation

### Typechecking

Factories are typed, so using the factory from the above example, these would both cause TypeScript compile errors:

```typescript
const user = factories.user.build();
user.foo; // type error! Property 'foo' does not exist on type 'User'
```

```typescript
const user = factories.user.build({ foo: 'bar' }); // type error! Argument of type '{ foo: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Partial<User>'.
```

### After-create hook

You can instruct factories to execute some code after an object is created:

```typescript
export default Factory.define<User>(({ sequence, afterCreate }) => {
  // TypeScript knows the type of `user` here ðŸŽ‰
  afterCreate(user => {
    user.name = 'Susan';
  });

  return {
    id: sequence,
    name: 'Bob',
  };
});
```
